This code contains:
  1. PIT code 
  2. ADC code
  3. DMA code
  
 
Progress: 
ADC works for one channel.
Timer works. 
DMA - doesn't enter interrupt and doesn't update the GloveInput Array but it updates reg values. (Mask and type cast issues)
The main file just uses adc and pit functions to convert from one channel for now and light up a LED, but all the code compiles with no errors. 

Our next steps:
  1. squentially implement conversion from 5 channels and light up LEDs
  2. Store ADC values in DMA and use DMA array to light up LEDs
