This code contains:
  1. PIT code 
  2. ADC code
  3. DMA code
  
The main file just uses adc functions to convert from one channel for now and light up a LED, but all the code compiles with no errors. our next steps:
  1. squentially implement conversion from 5 channels and light up LEDs
  2. use timer to read inputs 
  3. Store ADC values in DMA and use DMA array to light up LEDs
