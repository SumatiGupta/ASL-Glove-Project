This code contains:
  1. PIT code 
  2. ADC code
  3. DMA code
  
 
Progress: 
PIT interrupts every 1ms and starts conversion sequentially for 8 ADC values (last three are junk values). ADC values are read and put into 
GloveInputs array using DMA. 

GloveInputs values need to be shifted by 16 bits cuz the 32 sign-extension stores values in MSB instead of LSB 

Each LED is configured to light up based on one DMA input. 

Our next steps:
  1. clinch flex sensors 
  2. build flex sensor circuit 
  3. Test with new circuit 
  4. UART
